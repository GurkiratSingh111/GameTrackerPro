This application is the result of collaborative effort from Team Carbon
Our theme is nuts! Literally, its all about nuts.

Limitations:

    The game scores can't be negative. We added this constraint.
    This is to re-enforce the positivity of the cooperative gameplay.
    However this constraint can be removed if necessary.

Constraints:

    Player count set to 4 for the moment.
