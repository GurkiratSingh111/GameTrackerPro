Limitations:

    The game scores can't be negative. We added this constraint.
    This is to re-enforce the positivity of the cooperative gameplay.
    However this constraint can be removed if necessary.

Constraints:

    - If a photo is taken in an existing gameConfig/Session but not saved, a blank photo will save to the gallery still.
    - The max name for a game config is set to 30 characters.
    - The player count is set to be between 1-25. It can be expanded to more if necessary but limited to 25 for friendlier UI.


Non-Repeatable Bugs:

    Sometimes the fields inside the EditText for entering player scores will make the
    keyboard flash between number/alphabet layout a couple of times. Application
    resumes normal operation after flashing is finished. We were not able to replicate
    the bug on a consistent basis and you might notice it in testing.


Extension for Iteration 2:

    ** 2 day extension granted by Dr. Brian for iteration 2. **
