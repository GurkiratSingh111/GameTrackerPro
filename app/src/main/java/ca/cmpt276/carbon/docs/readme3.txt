Things we'd like to mention
----------------------------------

- If a photo is taken in an existing gameConfig/Session but not saved, a blank photo will save to the gallery still.
- The max name for a game config is set to 30 characters.
- The player count is set to be between 1-25. It can be expanded to more if necessary but limited to 25 for friendlier UI.
